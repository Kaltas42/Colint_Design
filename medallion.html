      <h3>Brief</h3>
      <p> In this project, Swinburne University was requested to produce a medallion coin that resonates the integrity of Swinburne and the Defence Sector.
      </p>
      <p>I was selected as one of the candidates in my class to work on this project after being reviewed by the Program Director and his officers. They loved two designs of the coin and had me collab with another student
        to further refine the medallion. Terry Ngo was my partner who designed the kangeroo side whereas I designed the Swinburne side. These 200+ medallions were produced for the senior officers of the Australian and 
        international defence forces, members of government defence departments, senior representatives of defence sector industry organisation and suppliers.

<p>Tools used: Adobe Illustrator, Indesign.</p>

      <h3>About this project</h3>
      <p>
        The university Council has endorsed the execution of the Defence Engagement Strategy including the creation of the Defence Operations Centre to provide a coordinated 
        approach to expanding Swinburne’s engagement with the defence industry sector.  As part of this engagement, medallion coin and associated memorabilia are to be created 
        as part of raising the profile of Swinburne’s involvement in the defence sector both with internal staff and leading stakeholders in the industry. 
Medallion coins feature strongly in the defence services and associated organisations as general memorabilia and collectables.  Their value is often derived from the limited 
access or criteria by which one can be received.  For example, some medallion coins are only available at the discretionary of current members of a specific military unit (i.e. naval vessel, army unit or airforce squadron).  Often they reflect the recipient’s support or participation in a specific event or achievement of the military unit.
Swinburne University will be opening its “Defence Operations Centre” around April/May 2024.  The coin may be used as part of the overall commemoration of this event.
